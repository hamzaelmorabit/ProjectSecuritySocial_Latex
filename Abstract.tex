Nowadays, information technologies have invaded all areas including education, transport, logistics, sports, etc. \\
The objective of this project is to take advantage of the facilities offered by information technologies to enhance e-health services. \\
More specifically, the goal is to improve the interaction between physicians and patients. This improvement is ensured by setting up
a mobile application that allows physicians to properly manage and monitor the health status of their patients. At the patient level, the application
will allow them to always have access to their medical records. \\

In this report, we will describe the features of the application, as well as the considered development process. At the technological level, the project was implemented in Java as an Android application with a nonSQL Firebase database.
